Task Manager! This is my version of a CLI task manager built using Node.js. 

One of the stipulations is no outside libraries, however the filestream that is used for CRUD of a .json file has to be imported, so I included a few others. Most API programs will use external libraries anyway.

pull the code,

$cd taskManager
$npm run test
